This work is a simulation of a garbage collector that traverses a grid cleaning the dirt (s), the agent has limited capacity and battery, if the battery is running out, it must go to the nearest recharge point (R) and recharge, the even if it has no space to store more dirt, it should go to a bin (L) and empty.
